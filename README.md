# Energy Forecasting Thesis - Code Repository

**Author:** Pauline Cox  
**Title:** Forecasting Building Energy Consumption 24 Hours Ahead: A Comparative Analysis of SARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM, and Hybrid Models

---

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation for a master's thesis comparing statistical, deep learning, and hybrid approaches for 24-hour ahead energy consumption forecasting in an office building. The analysis evaluates model performance under both stable operational periods and volatile conditions (holidays, irregular occupancy, seasonal transitions) to assess regime-dependent forecasting behavior.

### Key Finding

No single model dominates universally across all conditions. Statistical models (SARIMA, SARIMAX) excel during stable operational periods with predictable patterns, while LSTM neural networks maintain superior accuracy during volatile periods with irregular occupancy and non-standard events. PCA-based dimensionality reduction approaches neural network performance while preserving model interpretability, offering a practical middle ground for operational deployment.

## Models

### SARIMA (Baseline)
- Pure autoregressive model without exogenous features
- Seasonal ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1)[168] structure
- **Use case:** Stable conditions with regular patterns

### SARIMAX
- SARIMA extended with exogenous regressors
- Features selected via forward stepwise selection
- **Use case:** Stable conditions with known predictors

### SARIMAX-PCA
- SARIMAX with PCA-transformed environmental features
- Orthogonalizes correlated predictors to reduce multicollinearity
- **Use case:** Volatile conditions requiring robust linear features

### SARIMAX-Clustering
- SARIMAX with k-means regime indicators
- Binary encoding of weather/occupancy clusters
- **Use case:** Moderate volatility with identifiable regimes

### LSTM
- Deep learning sequence model with 168-hour lookback
- Two LSTM layers (128, 64 units) plus dropout regularization
- Direct 24-hour ahead prediction (no recursive forecasting)
- **Use case:** Volatile conditions requiring adaptability

### Hybrid (SARIMAX→LSTM)
- Sequential decomposition: SARIMAX baseline plus LSTM residual correction
- LSTM learns from SARIMAX residuals
- **Use case:** Balancing transparency and robustness

## Evaluation Framework

### Test Periods
- **Period A (Stable):** October 1-14, 2024 (336 hours)
- **Period B (Volatile):** December 18-31, 2024 (336 hours, includes holidays)

### Metrics
- **Point accuracy:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²
- **Statistical testing:** Diebold-Mariano tests with HAC correction
- **Error diagnostics:** Distributional analysis (skewness, kurtosis, normality)
- **Temporal patterns:** Hour-of-day and day-of-week accuracy profiles

### Key Results
- **During stable periods:** All models achieve similar accuracy (RMSE 33-39 kWh)
- **During volatility:** LSTM achieves 26% improvement over SARIMA
- **PCA-SARIMAX:** Approaches LSTM accuracy with only 4.5% gap while maintaining interpretability
- **Hybrid model:** Shows statistically significant and consistent improvements
